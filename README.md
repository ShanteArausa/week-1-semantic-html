Week 1 — Semantic HTML Landing Page
Overview

This project is a semantic HTML landing page created as part of my journey toward becoming an employable web developer. The focus was to build a clean, accessible, and well-structured webpage without relying on unnecessary <div> containers.

Goal

To understand and apply:

Semantic HTML structure
Proper heading hierarchy
Clean file organization

Basic Git workflow and version control

What I Learned

The purpose of foundational semantic elements
Why document hierarchy matters for accessibility and structure
How semantic HTML improves readability and maintainability
The importance of starting version control from the beginning of a project

Structure Used

<header> — Contains the site title and navigation
<main> — Holds the primary content of the page
<section> — Groups related content (About and Projects)
<article> — Represents individual project entries
<footer> — Contains copyright and social links
<h1> to <h3> — Used in proper hierarchical order

How to Run

Clone the repository
Open index.html in a web browser

Future Improvements

For example:

Add CSS styling
Improve accessibility with ARIA roles
Deploy to GitHub Pages
